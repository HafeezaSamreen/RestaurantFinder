## **Behind the Curtain: **Tech Stack &** Development**  

### **Frontend**: **React.js**  
Why? Because it's as flexible as pizza dough‚Äîperfect for dynamic, interactive interfaces.  

### **Backend**: **Spring Boot**  
Think of it as the chef‚Äôs assistant, ensuring all components communicate seamlessly.  

### **Database**: **MongoDB**  
We chose MongoDB for its adaptability, handling evolving data like a pro sous-chef.  

### **Cloud Hosting**: **Amazon AWS**  
AWS keeps our app responsive and available, even during the busiest dinner rush.  


## **The Recipe for Building This App: Pre-requisites**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prep Time: Local Setup**  
Before diving in, ensure your kitchen (computer) has:  
- **ReactJS**  
- **Java**  
- **Maven**  
- **MongoDB**  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Cook Time: Development Decisions**  
We chose the best ingredients:  
- **React.js (Frontend Framework)**: Why React.js: We chose React.js for its ability to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces efficiently. Its component-based structure ensures easy development and reusability, while the virtual DOM improves performance for search and filter operations. React's flexibility is ideal for integrating features like user authentication, review submissions, and restaurant detail displays. 
- **Spring Boot (Backend Framework)**: Why Spring Boot: For the back-end development, we selected Spring Boot due to its simplicity and seamless integration capabilities. It facilitates smooth communication between different parts of our website, ensuring a cohesive user experience. 
- **AWS (Cloud Provider)**: Why AWS: When it came to hosting our website, we turned to AWS for its robust cloud infrastructure and comprehensive suite of services. AWS ensures our website remains accessible and responsive, even during periods of high traffic.
- **MongoDB- NoSQL (Database)**: Why MongoDB: We chose MongoDB for its flexibility and developer-friendly nature, which makes it ideal for applications requiring dynamic and evolving data models. Unlike other NoSQL databases, MongoDB supports multiple levels of nested data without predefined structures, offering unparalleled versatility. Its schema-less design eliminates the need for upfront schema definitions, allowing for dynamic changes during development. Additionally, MongoDB provides secondary indexes, enabling efficient querying and making it more adaptable compared to alternatives like Cassandra.
- **MongoDB Hosting**: The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas, deployed in the us-west (Ohio) region. We use a three-node replica set with one primary and two secondary members, providing high availability and failover capabilities. The setup leverages MongoDB's managed services for simplicity, as the application does not require the scale of a full production environment.
- **Application Load Balancer (Deployment)**: The backend is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. The ALB distributes traffic across multiple targets and is configured with subnets in two different availability zones for redundancy. Health checks are implemented, requiring three consecutive successful checks to mark an instance as healthy.

## **Core Values: Our Secret Sauce**  

- **Communication**:  The team ensured effective communication through daily stand-ups, real-time collaboration via tools like Slack and GitHub, and pair programming. This open exchange of ideas helped clarify requirements, resolve issues quickly, and maintain alignment across all team members.
- **Simplicity**:  The team followed the "You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It" (YAGNI) principle, focusing only on essential features and avoiding over-engineering. By delivering simple, efficient solutions, the project remained adaptable, with a clean and manageable codebase.
